# TinderChallenge

a [Sails](http://sailsjs.org) application

Jonathan Lau Tinder Challenge
-----------------------------

 Hello! This is my submission for the Full Stack Tinder Coding Challenge.

 This application was created in Sails.js, utilizing the AngularJS library along with Hammer.js for the swiping gestures!

 Extras Included
 ---------------


  - Added two buttons: Like and Dislike.  Clicking on these buttons will essentially do the same as swipping left and right.
  - Swipping right displays a LIKE across the user profile, while swipping left displays a NOPE across the profile.
  - Displays the number of mutual interests based on user on each card.



The Application
----------
    * How to Run
    I was only able to test this program on localhost.  To run, you'll have to install Sails.js, which is similar to express, and
      then simply perform [sails lift] in the terminal to run.  Make sure you have mongo enabled!

    The application is routed to the root of the application: http://localhost:1337/
    Due to time contraints, I was only able to test if this renders on iPhone6 through an iphone simulator
      I used: http://www.responsinator.com/
